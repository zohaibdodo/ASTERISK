Log into your FreePBX server via SSH as the root user, using a tool such as PuTTY on Windows, or Terminal on Mac.
Next, bring up your FreePBX web interface in a web browser. Once the page has loaded, press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to highlight everything on the page.
Locate the unique session ID on the left side of the screen, and copy this string. It will look something like this: igg56njsp8bi0h4odqnupsq963
In your PuTTY or terminal window, type the following (be sure to replace the unique string with your own, and press enter):
[root@pbx ~]# fwconsole unlock igg56njsp8bi0h4odqnupsq963
Unlocking:
session unlocked!
[root@pbx ~]#
